##Research Experience


####Object Detection and  Transportation using the RC Rover
Undergraduate Thesis. Approved with Honors.
Simón Bolívar University, Caracas,  Venezuela.

**Summary:**  A system for real time image processing and robot control was implemented. It was trained to detect plastic bottles and to follow any other object through optical flow. Additionally, two complementary features were developed: Video interference detection and an image recollection system for neural network training.

####Simulation of Circadian Rhythms
Nakao Laboratory,  Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.

**Summary:** Two models, one deterministic and one stochastic, were implemented to simulate the circadian cycle in cyanobacteria. A variation of the stochastic model for molecule regulation was proposed.


##Relevant Projects


####Augmented Reality Hand Game
Simón Bolívar University, Caracas,  Venezuela.

**Summary:**  A game that implements hand gesture recognition, so the players can throw and catch simulated objects in the captured video on real-time.

####AI game development
Simón Bolívar University, Caracas,  Venezuela.

**Summary:** Game in 2.5D. Implements artificial intelligence techniques to generate intelligent behaviours.
